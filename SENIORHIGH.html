		<p id="pag1">I started school at the <b><q>Cebu Institute of Technology University</q></b> in my senior high year. The pandemic started when it was the last month of our junior year, so maybe when we were seniors, many of us stayed at home because of Covid-19. When our class was online, and at first I was happy, because as a person who doesn't like to socialized its a heaven for us, but as time goes by, I got tired with the set up. Instead of bonding and forming memories with my senior high classmates, we didn't do that because we never met or knew each other personally. We are very distant from each other, we have our own group in our section, they are close friends and they always chat. It's been 3 years since the pandemic started, and I don't want you to go back to this situation where everything is online. A lot of people have changed, for example the person who was active and cooperative, changed, hardly moves and is quiet on the side, and no longer likes to participate</p>
